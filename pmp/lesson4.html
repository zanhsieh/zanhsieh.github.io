## Project Time Management Overview
---
## Project Time Management Overview
---
## Plan Schedule Management
---
## Plan Schedule Management
- Establish the policies, procedures, and document for planning, managing, executing and controlling project schedule
- Provide guidance and direct on how the project schedule will be managed
---
## Schedule Management Plan
- Project schedule model development
- Level of accuracy
- Units of measure definition
- Organization procedure link
- Project schedule model maintenance
- Control threhold
  - Variance threshold allow before action is taken
- Rules of measurement
- Report format
???
- For level of accuracy, for projects last 2 year long, then the plan should be divided as monthly; for projects end very soon, the plan should be either weekly or daily
- Rules of measurement should address the rule for .red[ahead] / .red[delay] acknowledgement
---
## Define Activities
---
## Define Activities
- Identifying and documenting the work that is planned to be performed
- Identify the deliverables at the lowest level in the WBS, which is called the work package
- Defining and planning the schedule activities so that the project objectives will be met
---
## Define Activities (Input)
- Enterprise Environmental Factors
  - Organization culture, infrastructure, tools, HR, market conditions
- Organizational Process Assets
  - Internal policies, procedures, guidelines
- Project Baseline
  - Project deliverables, constraints, assumptions documented
---
## Define Activities (Tools and Techniques)
- Decomposition
  - Subdividing project work into smaller, more manageable components
- Rolling Wave Planning
  - Progressive elaboration planning where the work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail at a low level of the WBS
  - Schedule activities can exist at various levles of detail in the project life cycle
  - When insufficient definition of the project scope is available
    - Control Account - documented in a control account plan
- Expert Judgement
???
- Rolling Wave Planning is generally for insufficient scope and for unpredicable future WBS
---
## Define Activities (Output)
- Activity List
  - A comprehensive list including all schedule activities
  - Sufficient detail to understand what is required to be completed
  - Used in the schedule model and is a component of the project management plan
- Activity Attributes
  - Extension of the activity attributes; e.g. the activity identifier, activity codes, active description, predecessor activities, logical relationships
- Milestone List
  - Indicates whether the milestone is mandatory (required by the contract) or optional
---
## Sequence Activities
---
## Sequence Activities
- Identifying and documenting the logical relationships among schedule activities
- Provides leads and lags time support for a realistic and achievable project schedule
---
## Sequence Activities (Tools and Techniques)
- PRecedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
  - Uses boxes or rectangles, referred to as nodes, to represent activities
  - Connects with arrows that show the dependencies
  - Use in Critical Path Method (CPM)
  - Also called activity-on-node (AON)
---
## Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
---
## Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
---
## Activity Sequencing (Tools and Techniques)
- Schedule Network Templates
  - Especially useful when a project includes several identical or nearly identical deliverables
- Dependency Determination
  - Mandatory dependences
  - Discretionary dependencies
  - External dependencies
  - Internal dependencies
---
## Activity Sequencing (Tools and Techniques)
- Apply Leads and Lags
  - Lead allow an acceleration of successor activity
  - Lag directs a delay in the successor activity
---
## Estimate Activity Resource
---
## Estimate Activity Resource
- Determine what resources, whta quantities of each resource will be used
- Determine when each resource will be available
---
## Estimate Activity Resource (Tools and Techniques)
- Expert Judgement
- Alternatives Analysis
  - Using various levels of resource capability or skills, type of machines, and make-or-buy decisions
- Published Estimating Data
- Project Management Software
- Bottom-up Estimating
  - Work is decomposed into more detail when an activity cannot estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence
  - Detailed piece of work are estimated, and aggregated
---
## Estimate Activity Resource (Output)
- Activities Resource Requirements
  - Document for each schedule activity can include the basis of estimate for each resource, and assumptions
- Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)
- Project Document Update
  - Activity list
  - Activity attributes
  - Resource calendar
    - Identifies resource-specific holidays and resource availability periods
