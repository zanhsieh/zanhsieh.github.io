## Typical Sequence of Phase in Project Life Cycle
Missing picture here
---
## Characteristic of Project Phases

- Develop the project management plan
- Identify, define, mature the project scope, project cost, and schedule the project activities that occur within the project
- Should use stakeholders in project planning since the stakeholders have skills and knowledge that can be leveraged in developing the project management plan
- Several iteration may involved when changes occur. The feedback and refinement process cannot continue indefinitely
---
## Executing Process Group
- Use to complete the work defined in the project management plan to accomplish the project requirements
- Coordinating people and resources
- Integrating and performing the activities of the project in accordance with the project management plan
